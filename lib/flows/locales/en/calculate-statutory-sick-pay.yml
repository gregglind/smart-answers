      title: Calculate your employee's Statutory Sick Pay
      body: |
        Check if an employee qualifies for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) and how much to pay them.

        ## What you’ll need to know

        You’re only responsible for paying SSP if:


        - you pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions for them
        - you don’t provide your own occupational sick pay scheme
        - your employee was sick for at least 4 days in a row during their last period of illness (this includes bank holidays, weekends and non-working days)
        - your employee has told you they’re sick within 7 days of first missing work or within the time limits of your own rules

          ##Your employee is entitled to sick pay:

          + £%{ssp_payment} in total
          + for %{days_paid} days taken off sick between %{sick_start_date} and %{sick_end_date}

          The first 3 days of any period of illness (or any linked periods of illness separated by less than 8 
          weeks) won’t be paid. The payment amount will reflect this.

          SSP can be paid for up to 28 weeks of an employee’s normal workdays. For this employee that equals a 
          total of %{max_days_payable} days. After that you must give them form SSP1 within 7 days of SSP ending. They may be able to get [Employment Support Allowance (ESA).](https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance "Benefits & credits: employment support allowance (ESA)")
