        This calculator gives an estimate for your basic State Pension. 

        It doesn’t estimate any [Additional State Pension.](/additional-state-pension "Additional State Pension")

        You’ll be asked for the number of years you worked and paid National Insurance or got certain benefits. These are the years of your [National Insurance contributions](/national-insurance "National Insurance") that count towards your State Pension.

        Count tax years from 6 April to 5 April and don’t count any years twice (eg when you were working and getting benefits). Don’t count the current tax year.
        
        This calculator uses a simplified calculation based on the current law. It can't take into account every circumstance that might affect you. Don't make future financial decisions based on its results.
